        <p>Reading is hobby is a fruitful work done in spare time. There is no monetary benefit in a hobby. It is pursued only for pleasure. It is based purely on interest and enjoyment and no other consideration. Thus, a hobby is totally different from a profession or occupation. What is a hobby for one may be an occupation for another person? An occupation is a regular work done to earn bread and butter.</p>

                <h3>My favourite book is Gulivers Travel</h3>
        <h3>Gulliver's Travels is an adventure story (in reality, a misadventure story) involving several voyages of Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon, who, because of a series of mishaps en route to recognized ports, ends up, instead, on several unknown islands living with people and animals of unusual sizes, behaviors, and philosophies, but who, after each adventure, is somehow able to return to his home in England where he recovers from these unusual experiences and then sets out again on a new voyage.</h3>
